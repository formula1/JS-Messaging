# Abstract Aspects
- Commit 100% to Promises - Async/Await will come one day
- All Managers Work exactly the same
  - Need to define properly What a manager is
- Split up 'clientData and responseData' information
- Provide Import/Export
  - Allows passing of sockets
  - May proxy it if that is not possible

# User Freindlyness
- Synchronized Data Module
  - Basically getter/setters around events
- JSON RPC
  - Get Requests formatted very specifically
- Iterator Abstract
  - I should be using highland more if I want to get in on this
- Constructor / Piping
- Use someone elses router?
